# Google Map Embed in HTML
This project is to embed Google Maps iframe tag in your .html file to 
provide the exact location of the area in Google map.

Here I embed India map from Google to show how ifram used to show the map.

I also developed India flag on right side of the map to show how to develop the flag
using just HTML and CSS.
